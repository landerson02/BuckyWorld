# Deploying MySQL DB on Docker

## Start by pulling an image (choose an image first)

ex.  `docker pull ubuntu:latest`

## Create a Dockerfile for installations/commands to run

### docker commands:

We still need to choose an image to pull from

helpful documentation for how to use docker commands

[docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)

## Create a docker-compose.yml file

ex.

```
version: '3.1'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: db
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DB: mydatabase

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db-data:

```

- Defines two services: app (your application) and db (the MySQL database)

- Builds application from the Dockerfile in the current directory

- Maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 on the container for our app

- Sets up environment variables for your application to connect to the MySQL database

- Uses a Docker volume named db-data to persist the MySQL database data.
      - Likely applicable to us because we don't want user data to disappear



## Build & Run the container

`docker-compose build`

`docker-compose up`


# Connect to Spring Backend


## Directions

the link discusses an autogenerated zipfile given that could potentially help us with dependencies
